            G'day. I'm a customer experience (CX) focused digital strategy & transformation consultant. I am an empathetic problem-solver, a technical designer and a business-minded people-person.

              <br>
              In my current role, I help enterprise clients in embracing customer centricity (CX), defining IT strategies, and reinvent operating models to fit their digital needs. I studied Software Development at school, and in the past have worked as an iOS, Automation, and Web developer, in the Transport and Cyber Security sectors. I have also spent the past 3 years leading nonprofit teams and projects.
