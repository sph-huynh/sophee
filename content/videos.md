**UNIHACK Melbourne Promo**
----

This is possibly the only serious video I have ever made. We are expanding our Marketing in UNIHACK to short videos on social media, and this is the first of 2018.

Some parts were shot on a Sony a7ii by me, and other parts were taken by other team members (Dan and Felix).
Graphics were put together by Ben.

**GovHack 2017**
----

I came into this hackathon as a last minute addition to the team, with one sole purpose - make a video in 5 hours. [SaferRoads](https://github.com/ShawTech) was a heatmap that would show dangerous roads based on weather and road fatality data. The AR app at 0:56 is 100% serious, and not for fun. "Hot and new technologies, such as Kotlin", also 100% not a joke.

Parts were shot on a Sony a7ii, and other parts was stock footage.

**Google Student Ambassador Program**
----

When applying for [the program](https://www.facebook.com/googlemonash/), we were asked to make videos either describing why we were Googley or to make an 'ad' for joining the program. I opted for the latter. This was also made with footage from travelling, with some filmed specifically for this video in Melbourne, Australia and Songdo, South Korea.

This was shot on a Sony a7II.

**Be the change** 
----

This was a video made for the Global Discovery Program, with the theme "Change the world". The words mean nothing in particular, but was made with the purpose of being 'generally inspirational'. It was made with various footage I have taken whilst travelling. I must emphasise that the narration has no meaning. Like, absolutely no meaning.

This was shot on a Sony a7II.

**The Global Discovery Program**
----

Yes, this is the same program I made the previous video for. Yes, this is a really terrible video. Yes, I am 100% a little salty for not making it through that year. 

This video was edited on a premium software that limited the ability to export videos, so I turned on my screen recorder, and played the video in the video editor.

**UNIHACK Maxi**
----

This was an [April Fools joke](https://www.facebook.com/unihackmelb/videos/1034707806576208/), with buzzwords galore. [UNIHACK](unihack.net) is a technical hackathon for teritiary students, run by students. We launched UNIHACK Mini aimed at first year students with no prior hackathon or software development experience. UNIHACK Maxi was a parody in response to Mini.

This was shot on a Sony a7II. The song, Warhammer, is made by [Purple Planet Music](http://www.purple-planet.com).

**Monash Photography Club**
----
This was the first video I ever made! It was a summary video displayed at the Annual General Meeting for Monash Photography Club in 2015.

This was shot on a Canon 5D, and a Oneplus One.

**GovHack 2015**

This was my first hackathon. I was not confident enough to write any code, and worked on the video instead.
