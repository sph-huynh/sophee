## Case Study Overview
In my first semester in university, I studied Peter Singer, Contract Law, Management theory and Extremism in politics and religion. I originally wanted to become an IP lawyer. Imagine my absolute confusion when I find myself pivoting into the technology sector.

I am very grateful to have found an amazing mentor in my early years of university. However, over time, I found that there was a wave of ‘new age’ digital roles that my mentor did not know about, and universities do not tell you about either. As a result, I’ve personally spent my entire career slowly moving into different fields trying to find something that I enjoy. And in addition, I’ve found myself increasingly giving career advice to young female computer science students who also don’t know what they want to do.

In my career advice conversations, I always ask about the students background and also why they enjoy the things they do. I ask about the why so that I can pull out their skill set and see what roles it would fit in. I’ve had the chance to play the role of a recruiter at SDSN Youth, and have realised many people will pick careers based off of domain or title instead of skill fit. What you get is a) missed opportunities in jobs they would have enjoyed AND excelled in and b) people underestimating their skillset as being limited to information, rather than know-how.

I have this slide that I often show about the different areas in tech. It’s pretty primal and I’ve always felt like this insight would benefit a lot of students. So I’ve decided to combine these career advice conversations and my mapping of the digital sector into a website.

### Target audience
I’m looking to target two personas: 
- People who are looking for the ‘right’ career fit in digital; and
- People looking to explore moving around in digital.

For both personas, I’m looking to help show what skills are required in each role, what experience you need, and pathways to move into them.

### Constraints
- I’m acknowledging that I’m prototyping the website first based on the needs I’ve seen in my quasi career - interviews and through my own experience.
- I hope to share this around and validate/seek feedback around usability and the key features

## Process
- What I do know about this common struggle of finding the right career fit is:
- Not knowing what the options are
- Not knowing how these roles work with each other
- Not knowing the similarities or overlaps so someone could shift between fields

With these in mind, I had a couple of guiding principles. I want the website to..
- Be super easy to get your results (suggested roles)
- Be as informational and actionable as possible (show all key information that a mentor or career coach would tell you)

So the structure I’ve landed on goes like this:
1. Front page jumps straight into the quiz
2. The quiz will take a number of inputs
- Education
- Capabilities
- Domain areas of interest
3. Then suggest some recommendations
4. The user can also choose to see all career options in detail
- What the role does
- What type of companies offer these roles
- How to learn more
- Pathways to move into these roles
- Career progression

I’m also using this opportunity to learn 11ty and try out the Netlify CMS.

## Outcome
This project is still in progress, but you can have a look at the website here: https://cranky-stonebraker-fa5ab1.netlify.app
