I led the technology track of an IT strategy engagement with a utilities client - allowing the client to better understand what immersive technologies (i.e. AR, VR, MR) they could use to better improve the training and compliance of their line workers.

This project aimed to create a tech strategy for a utilities company so they could assess the suitability of using extended reality for training employees.

How can we use tech such as AR/VR to better the learning experience?

### Challenge

A utilities company has over 2000 employees that work in highly specialised and compliance heavy work. They are required to put safety first and also have a number of trainings that are regulated by a third party. Our client was considering using immersive learning technologies to better improve the retention and access to important knowledge. However they lacked the expertise to understand how they could assess the suitability of this technology.

### Solution
We ran a number stakeholder interviews and desktop research to further understand the training use cases and potential application with technology. We prioritised the use cases and dug deeper into implementation costs in order to form a roadmap. I led the technical track, including implementation research.

### Outcome
Co-developed the Immersive Learning strategy and validation framework, producing a number of educational and diagnostic assets for the client to assess different types of Extended Reality (i.e. AR, VR, MR) technologies to use in their internal training. The client has since used our prioritisation framework to successfully allocate a budget of $500k to create a VR learning experience pilot.
