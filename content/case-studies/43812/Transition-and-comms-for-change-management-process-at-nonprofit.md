### Challenge

A dysfunctional team was affecting a lot of teams in the organisation. As a result. specific responsibilities were cut out of this team, and were inherited by my team. The responsibilities of this team were highly intertwined, and many stakeholders would have been affected by the split. We had to ensure stakeholders were well informed and did not feel like these were changes they had no say in, given a history of these individuals feeling disempowered.

### Solution
* I spearheaded the planning of how the split and transition would happen
* Managing discussions between the decision makers and the immediate team members that were affected
* Created the communications strategy, and coordinated the dissemination of information - ensuring the right amount of info to the right stakeholders
* Provided space for affected individuals to still provide input in the changes, so that we would be taking the change journey together and not simply imposing change"

### Outcome
- Team members affected by the change had a clear understanding of what was happening, with the opportunity to contribute their inputs as well
- Follow up initiatives were launched immediately to back up the changes, but also show that the input sought was not temporary. But was part of a greater wave of changes (for the better)
- Immediately I revised the team structure and current streams of work, and started a recruitment campaign to fill roles that would focus on improvements and streamlining of the projects
