## Case Study Overview
I created the vision and implemented the creation of a joint student-faculty initiative, diversIT. diversIT aims to support under-represented students in the Monash University Faculty of IT. 
 
Under my leadership, we gained over 300 students, prominent Melbourne-based tech companies as sponsors, and community partnerships within our first 5 months – also receiving the Commendation Award from the Vice-Chancellor in July 2017.
 
### Challenge
Technology is integrated throughout our daily lives, touching everything we do - from social media, to workplace tools, to household appliances. Because of this, representation in the technology sector is even more critical. Why? Because diverse representation directly affects the services and products our society consumes (e.g. detrimental biases in product design due to homogenous teams, opportunities to underrepresented groups in tech, toxic work cultures and bullying in the workforce.)
 
There are 3 key periods in our lives that can affect one’s interest in the technology industry: Younger formative years (toddler - high school), university/high education and post-entrance to industry. I was focusing on the university space.
 
### Constraints
Given that Monash University was quite saturated in student clubs, there were a few key differences about diversIT:
1. Joint faculty-student initiative. Which removes the pressure to run events as a source of income to keep the initiative afloat.
2. An ecosystem, holistic approach to support. Whilst events provide great opportunities to meet people and build communities - there was no shortage of events at Monash, so we were focusing on different gaps i.e. mentorship, pathways to industry, etc.
3. Recognising that underrepresented groups do not equal just women. It’s extremely important to recognise intersectionality in diversity - which many other student/tech groups do not.
 
### Target audience
We defined underrepresentation as:
- identifying as female;
- racial or religious background;
- the LGBTQIA+ community;
- disability - mental or physical
- Indigenous or Torres Strait Islander,
- low socio-economic class.
 
## Process
I had about 2 months at the time to plan, and then we had to immediately start executing. There were a few key milestones for me:
1. Business case to the faculty - to agree on the partnership
2. Orientation week - to capture student interest at its peak
3. Validating needs - to design the initiative
4. Rapidly building a community - in order to consolidate our foundations before moving into less visible initiatives
5. Hand over - I had a soft departure date in 6 months
### 1. Business case
The business case focuses on addressing a few key points: How involved would the faculty be? How would the initiative work? How do we address the saturated student leadership space?
 
diversIT had 4 pillars:
1. Building a community
2. Career initiatives
3. Mentoring connections
4. Connecting alumni
 
The idea being that in the same way representation is a multifaceted problem that has multiple challenges, diversIT aimed to be a multifaceted initiative that would support a student from every part of their journey with the university.
### 2. Orientation week & Validating needs
We sent out an EOI form to join the initiative, and asked a number of questions to gauge key needs and the demographics of our members.

**Key findings** 
- Key wants revolved around career advice
- Majority of the members were from Computer Science, Information Technology (our generalist degree) or double degree.
- Out of 279 members, we had a almost 50:50 split of undergraduate vs postgraduate 
 
 
### 4. Rapidly building a community
This came in three forms:
1. Visibility with student members
2. Exposure and interest to company partners
3. Building a core team of volunteers
 
As we had very few people in the team, and little resources - I chose to engage in a few activities to maximise our progress in these three goals:
 
1. Having a faculty member present all meetings. Not only to reinforce the join partnership aspect of the initiative, but also to give the student team members a chance to build their own relationship with faculty members.
2. Afternoon tea event with Google - our first public event. Having it with Google (when Google had previously never partnered with any student initiative at Monash, was a great way for us to establish legitimacy). This was an intimate event where students got to sit and have coffee with Google engineers. Also a great opportunity to get photos for our branding!

3. Design Thinking workshop with IBM - Introducing students to non technical concepts in the technology sector.
4. Trivia Night - first standalone event to test the waters.
5. [Partnership pitch to IBL corporate partners](https://soph.ee/docs/diversit.pdf) - to secure interest and momentum for the following year.
6. Diversity and Inclusion Panel - during D&I week with a number of senior leaders in the industry.

## Outcome
Under my leadership, we gained over 300 students, prominent Melbourne-based tech companies as sponsors, and community partnerships within our first 5 months – also receiving the [Commendation Award from the Vice-Chancellor](https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/monash-contributions-to-diversity-and-inclusion-recognised) in August 2017.

You can also see various publications that I was featured in to talk about diversIT with Monash University.
 
Here is the initial pitch deck I used to present to Monash University’s IT Industry Based Learning Partners - this group included recruiters and managers from companies like Deloitte, EY, Accenture, Reece and much more.
