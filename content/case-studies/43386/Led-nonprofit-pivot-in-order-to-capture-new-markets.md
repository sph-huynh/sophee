## Case Study Overview
To tackle a set of key challenges we were facing at UNIHACK, I led the team to pivot the timing of our flagship to test a hypothesis about the way we were making sales. We were cutting our preparation time by half (12 months to 5 months), had a significantly smaller team, and had to navigate accessing the annual budgets of our sponsors before the end of the financial year.

### Target audience

### Constraints

## Process
We started with a heavy focus on team bonding, and reflection of the last event. It was an imperative that we a) worked well together and b) that the why, what and how was crystal clear. The rationale takes from the concept of high-performing teams - that if you have a team of high-performing individuals, you can break the time-cost-scope paradox.

## Outcome
We broke the time-cost-scope paradox. Our shift from an August to March event captured new sponsors â€“ leading to a 15% increase in revenue with 66% less team members and 60% less preparation time. Mentors and sponsors of the event gave outstanding feedback!
