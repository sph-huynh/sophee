This article was originally published on Monash University's website.

Monash University featured a story about me founding the diversity in IT focused faculty initiative 'diversIT'.

## Recognising and celebrating diversIT - supporting diversity and fostering inclusion at Monash

Students go above and beyond to further inclusion, cohesion, connection and belonging for people from underrepresented groups in IT.

DiversIT is a support network developed by students, for students. It aims to build and facilitate aculture of inclusion and diversity within the Faculty of IT at Monash. With the aim of enhancing the feeling of connection and belonging for the diverse community of students, diversIT is also looking to engage with the wider community to encourage participation by underrepresented groups.

“Different perspectives and open minds lead to great things, and I honestly hope others find the importance in diversity as much as we do.” This is the key message Sophia Huynh, diversIT Student Lead, wanted to resonate with readers.

Sophia goes on to share that it isn’t just a matter of addressing one challenge. Whilst there’s an emphasis on women in IT, the group want to extend their message to address other diversity concerns in the technical landscape in Australia. There isn’t just one way to effect change. We need to recognise what we have the capacity to do and act on all factors that we are not comfortable accepting. Whether this be demystifying tech to younger students, ensuring high school students know that there are people like them in the workforce, reiterating to tertiary students that it is okay to seek support, and that support will continue throughout their time at Monash, Sophia explains.
