## Recognising and celebrating diversIT - supporting diversity and fostering inclusion at Monash

Monash University featured a story about me founding the diversity in IT focused faculty initiative 'diversIT'.
'Sophia goes on to share that it isn’t just a matter of addressing one challenge. Whilst there’s an emphasis on women in IT, the group want to extend their message to address other diversity concerns in the technical landscape in Australia.'
