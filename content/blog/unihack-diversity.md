## Talking About Diversity-Again...At Hackathons?

We were once asked by a competitor, why do we have diversity initiatives for the hackathon when it is ‘irrelevant’?

I understand the frustration from this competitor — the idea of giving somebody else an unfair advantage, or maybe the idea of taking away opportunities [from others] for the sake of quotas?

Considering the way technology is integrated throughout our daily lives, how it will define our future, and the growth of this industry, I find it very difficult to call these initiatives ‘irrelevant’. The lack of diverse representation in technology has very real and serious impacts on not only the industry itself but also the products that our society consumes as well.

Diversity in IT is a multi-faceted problem, and you can see this in:
1. The blame we are placing on the underrepresented groups for their lack of representation (see: [when marketing stopped women coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding), [alarmingly low numbers of Black/Latino/Indigenous people](https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/16/the-3-percent-why-tech-has-a-diversity-problem/) in the North American Tech Industry, [college affordability becoming increasingly difficult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83366/) for low-income or first-generation students).
2. Areas where the product shows a bias of homogenous teams who created it (like the time when [facial recognition thought a Chinese man’s eyes were closed](https://www.cnet.com/news/new-zealand-facial-recognition-eyes-closed-error-rejected-richard-lee/), or when [face-tracking software was unable to recognise black people](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2009/12/hp-face-tracking-webcams-dont-recognise-black-people/) because it was [trained with white engineers](https://www.recode.net/2017/1/18/14304964/data-facial-recognition-trouble-recognizing-black-white-faces-diversity)).
3. The drop out rates of people who fall in these groups because of divisive, [toxic work cultures](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber), and [bullying in the workforce](https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/TechLeavers2017.pdf).

Not to mention there’s also [the way we bring up our children](https://www.educationandemployers.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DrawingTheFuture.pdf) (and before you tell me something like women just ‘aren’t interested’ or are ‘biologically incapable’, please see the: [70% of STEM grads in Iran who are women](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002315/231519e.pdf) and the [45% of CS degree holders in India who are women](http://www.hcixb.org/papers_2017/hcixb17-final-37.pdf)).

We need more role models, and to emphasise the benefits, like increased creativity, productivity, and efficiency of teams.
