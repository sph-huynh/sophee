This article was originally published on UNIHACK Inc's Medium blog.

We were recruiting for new volunteers in the UNIHACK team. In order to give potential applicants a glimpse into what we do and how we operate, I interviewed a number of our volunteers and wrote a 4-part series. The series aims to highlight the various experiences, backgrounds and how our experience helped us grow professionally/personally.

## Hold out your hand, and join our UNIHACK Fam ❤

In any job, you’ve usually got two approaches to choose from — go hard or go home.

In the UNIHACK Fam, we like to go hard and push for the greatest results we can possibly get. There are a lot of lessons to learn in a high-functioning team. Many people don’t realise that there can be more to a student-run organisation than just semi-hard labour and partying hard.

In that sense, UNIHACK stands out, not only do our audience appreciate our events — tech people are always yearning to learn — but we also push our own boundaries as far as we can go. We’re not restricted by a governing body and we get to pick the direction we want to go.

This is not to say that our only goals are simply to work, work, work — we do our best to maximise the learnings of our team members and of course, to have as much cheeky fun as we can on the way.

We want to share that experience with you.

I imagine it can be a bit difficult to understand what the experience is like without a) knowing what we do on a day-to-day basis and b) seeing what we achieve at the end.
