Monash University featured an interview with me in regard to founding diversIT, a student initiative that aims to support underrepresented IT students. We won a Commendation for the Vice-Chancellor’s Diversity and Inclusion Awards in 2017.

### Meet Sophia Huynh of DiversIT

We recently spoke with recent Monash alumna Sophia Huynh, who helped lead one of last year’s winning initiatives, DiversIT.

Sophia started university as a business student, but eventually transitioned into studying IT. It wasn’t always a comfortable transition – women are underrepresented in STEM fields, which can be a lonely experience. At a coffee meet-up Sophia was introduced to a mentor who helped her find her feet and become more comfortable in a field dominated by men.

When these structured coffee sessions ended in 2016, Sophia was disappointed.

“The idea of having women from STEM talk to each other and form a community was really nice,” she said.

When Chris Gonsalvez, the IT faculty’s associate dean of Student Engagement, mentioned the importance of diversity in Information Technology, Sophia took it upon herself to create an initiative dedicated to diversifying the field.

That initiative, DiversIT, expanded to involve people of all underrepresented groups, including the LGTBIQ community, the disadvantaged, people with disability and indigenous groups. It became a support network aimed at building and facilitating a culture of inclusion and diversity within the Faculty of IT at Monash and beyond.

“One thing that stood out to me is that people are passionate about this, but won’t say anything without a platform,” Sophia said. “It’s a trendy topic and something IT companies expect you to care about, almost to the point where it doesn’t seem sincere. Students don’t bring it up, but they want to. I was surprised by the response. It blew me away.”
