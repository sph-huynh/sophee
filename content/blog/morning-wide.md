During a trip to Seoul in 2015, my room mate and I were invited to be a part of a South Korean morning show.

We were picked up by the Director and Assistant in the morning, and drove over to [Herb Island in Pocheon](http://dmaps.kr/2co5d).

caption2="It's most well-known for being the setting for a few succesful South Korean dramas, and we were to be exploring the place as a tourists." 
caption3="It's quite funny because I was terrible at acting, but had better pronounciation, where as my room mate had a clear accent but was much better at playing the part." >}}

It was a very interesting experience, my room mate speaking more Korean than I did, and our temporary colleagues not speaking much English.

The day in aired on TV, we got up at 6am so that we could catch it. It is extremely hard to watch now, but most definitely one of my most memorable experiences of the trip.
