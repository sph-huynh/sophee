content2 = "In Feburary 2015, I was reading about the Green Climate Fund in Songdo for the first time. 10 months later, I stayed with a beautiful family in Songdo. I was blown away by their hospitality and how open they were. The father also happened to work at the Green Climate Fund, and introduced me to other Executives there and showed me around. I wouldn't have had this experience if I wasn't open to new things."

content2 = "So what better to do, than go on photography walks with strangers? Go to language exchange with strangers? Drive 5 hours up South Korea to be on a Korean morning show with strangers? These activities were not exactly done on purpose, but exactly 100% memorable."

title = "And that's the thing, not everything needs to have a purpose."
content1 = "For a long time, I was looking for mine. My interests have always been pretty broad, I wanted to be many things: a Graphic Designer, an IP Lawyer, or a Paramedic - but then I did my first Data Structures/Algorithms subject. Whilst I did pretty damn terribly in this unit, I thought to myself, Wow I have never used my brain so hard before, and I loved it."
content2 = "So I moved into technology. I decided to get more involved with the IT Faculty. And here, I was able to really see the value of community. The first one I joined was the Google Student Ambassador Program, where I met amazing students from all over Australia and New Zealand. It was an amazing experience, and really opened my mind to the potential scale of projects."

content2 = "And most importantly, I learned how to believe in myself, and aim high."

title = "I learned to initiate."
content1 = "Don't just talk the talk, do the walking too. I decided to start diversIT, because why not? I gained a lot from a mentor I met at a women in IT event, and felt that I needed to give back. We launched and signed up 300 students, several sponsors and ran successful events, along with a Commendation from the Vice-Chancellor in our first 6 months."
content2 = "One of my favourite events was a panel we ran, where we had senior managers in the tech industry to student leaders at the university, talk about the importance of company culture. This was in response to recent stories from Uber and Google. It was important to me to initiate respectful conversation."

I ended up working on rebuilding the Global Communications Team, and building our Technology capabilities from scratch. I didn't plan for any of this when I joined - not leading teams nor going to New York for it either."
